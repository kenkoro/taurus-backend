# Taurus co. restful API

See [wiki](https://github.com/kenkoro/taurus-restful-api/wiki). This is my first freelance project, and here I'm using
kotlin language for the mobile client as well as for this backend app. Also, I usually like to develop my projects as trunk-based
ones, meaning where a team collaborates on code in a single branch called **trunk**.
